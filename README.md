# RevisionApp
This is the revision app that was created using a MEAN stack
This server side will be the backbone to  an app that will be launched in the near future.

The plan is to first make an online version of the app and then create an api which can be used by other devices to interact with the database.


This is an old project which was re made for my computer science IA. Can be seen at https://github.com/francy51/RevisionAppRefactor
